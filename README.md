# MindStone
RAM/Memory Imaging Module for KAPE utilising WinPmem

New version of WinPmem released https://github.com/Velocidex/WinPmem/releases

MindStone Module uses winpmem_mini_x64_rc2.exe

Old WinPmem Module versons in KAPE did not work. New WinPmem Module created named MindStone, successfully tested on Win10.
Yet to be tested on x86 OS systems, there is an x86 verson of WinPmem. I will move onto this is due course.


Update @ 16/10/2020 New verson WinPmem_mini_x64_rc2.exe currently only images RAM/Memory. AFF4 possible implementation in the future.
